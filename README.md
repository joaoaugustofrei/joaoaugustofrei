I’m João Freire, Master in Applied Economics, Data Scientist, and Front-End developer.

My current interests are Machine Learning, ETL, and data visualization with Python, SQL, and R.

Right now, I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the intent of becoming a front-end developer as well.

I would love to colaborate on data science projects, especially concerning machine learning and data visualization.

You can reach me through my e-mail joaoaugustofrei@gmail.com or my LinkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C3%A3o-augusto-freire-975a69112/.
